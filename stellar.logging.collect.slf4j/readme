siriushq/stellar.logging.collect.slf4j
======================================

SLF4J (under MIT) collector for the logging system.

The presence of this artifact on the class-path or module-path will cause it
to be automatically registered (service loaded).

This artifact should not be used in tandem with the SLF4J dispatcher.
It would lead to an infinite logging loop being created.
