siriushq/stellar
================

	There are many available sources of documentation for users and contributors.
	Rendered source documentation is available in the "target" directory for any
	given module after building. https://stellar.sirius.cam houses the handbook.

	<!> The handbook is currently not public.
	<!> Release 1.0 is not published yet.

	<ⓘ> stellar.logging & stellar.facility are usable & stable.
	<ⓘ> stellar.esthree is usable but not feature-complete yet.
	<ⓘ> stellar.platform* is to be deleted.
	<ⓘ> TBD — stellar.cluster, stellar.configuration, stellar.security,
	    stellar.throttle, stellar.serialization, stellar.metrics
	<ⓘ> Contact "stellar@mechite.com" for support (more information below...)

building
========

	The preferred environment includes Oracle GraalVM for Java 21 and the Apache
	Maven Daemon (mvnd), or any suitable distribution of Maven.

	Then, either the `package` or `install` goals can be used.
	`git clone git@github.com:siriushq/stellar.git && cd stellar && mvnd package`

contributing
============

	Currently, in general, contributions are not accepted.
	However, you can submit patches [1], or report issues/bugs to `stellar@mechite.com`.
	A response will always eventually be provided to anything delivered to this address.

=========

	While the project is licensed and will be licensed with CC BY-NC 4.0 for the
	foreseeable future, licenses may eventually be available for the general public.

	Special access can be granted to users and organizations by request.
	Responses will always be attempted within 24 hours — licenses can be obtained fast.
	Given tolerable grounds, licenses will be offered free of charge to a majority of users.
