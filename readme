================

There are many available sources of documentation for users and contributors.
Rendered source documentation is available in the "target" directory for any
given module after building. https://stellar.sirius.cam houses the handbook.

<!> The handbook is currently not public.
<!> 1.0-RC1 will be published when the task list implied below is complete.

<ⓘ> stellar.logging & stellar.facility are usable & stable.
<ⓘ> stellar.esthree is not feature-complete yet.
<ⓘ> stellar.facility* — many portions to migrate/extract outside
<ⓘ> TBD — stellar.cluster, stellar.configuration, stellar.security,
    stellar.throttle, stellar.serialization, stellar.metrics
<ⓘ> Contact "stellar@mechite.com" for support (more information below...)

including
=========

Releases and release-candidates are published to our repository.
Start by adding this to your project.

	pom.xml ====================================
	<repositories>
		<repository>
			<id>sirius</id>
			<url>https://maven.sirius.cam/</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
	============================================

A bill-of-materials is provided to control dependency versions.
Directly add `stellar-bom` (or use `stellar` to also use our build lifecycle).

	pom.xml ========================================
	<dependencyManagement>
		<dependencies>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>sirius.stellar</groupId>
				<artifactId>stellar</artifactId>
				<version>1.0-RC1</version>
				<scope>import</scope>
				<type>pom</type>
			</dependency>
		</dependencies>
	</dependencyManagement>
	================================================

Finally, register (& require) any dependencies you need.
You should exclude the versions when using `dependencyManagement`.
For example, to use `stellar-logging`:

	pom.xml ====================================
	<dependency>
		<groupId>sirius.stellar</groupId>
		<artifactId>stellar-logging</artifactId>
	</dependency>
	============================================

	module-info.java ===============
	requires sirius.stellar.logging;
	================================

building
========

The preferred environment includes Oracle GraalVM for Java 25 and the Apache
Maven Daemon (mvnd), or any other suitable distribution of Maven.

	$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:siriushq/stellar.git
	$ cd stellar
	$ mvnd package

An installation of GnuPG is required to run the `install` or `deploy` goals
(alternatively, use `-Dgpg.skip` flag to skip, not recommended!)

contributing
============

Contributions are accepted as long as they fall within implied project scope.

All commits must contain at least `Signed-off-by` to identify the author of the
contribution, and may contain `Co-authored-by` to attach any number of other
authors (this can be added automatically with `git commit ... -s ...`).

(furthermore, commits from people with repository write access are to be signed
with a verified GPG, SSH or S/MIME signature attached to your GitHub account).

Relevant documentation should be updated to include accrediting. For example,
JavaDoc comments on type declarations should contain name & GitHub username:

	@author John Doe (jdoe)
