================

	There are many available sources of documentation for users and contributors.
	Rendered source documentation is available in the "target" directory for any
	given module after building. https://stellar.sirius.cam houses the handbook.

	<!> The handbook is currently not public.
	<!> 1.0-RC1 will be published when the task list implied below is complete.

	<ⓘ> stellar.logging & stellar.facility are usable & stable.
	<ⓘ> stellar.esthree is not feature-complete yet.
	<ⓘ> stellar.platform* is to be deleted.
	<ⓘ> TBD — stellar.cluster, stellar.configuration, stellar.security,
	    stellar.throttle, stellar.serialization, stellar.metrics
	<ⓘ> Contact "stellar@mechite.com" for support (more information below...)

	TODO - markdown-ify JavaDoc in sirius.stellar.facility.tuple.*
	TODO - markdown-ify JavaDoc in sirius.stellar.logging.*

including
=========

	Releases and release-candidates are published to our repository.
	Start by adding this to your project.

	pom.xml ===================================================
	<repositories>
		<repository>
			<id>sirius</id>
			<url>https://maven.sirius.cam/</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
	===========================================================

	A bill-of-materials is provided to control dependency versions.
	Add this to your project.

	pom.xml ===================================================
	<dependencyManagement>
		<dependencies>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>sirius.stellar</groupId>
				<artifactId>stellar-bom</artifactId>
				<version>1.0-RC1</version>
				<scope>import</scope>
				<type>pom</type>
			</dependency>
		</dependencies>
	</dependencyManagement>
	===========================================================

	Finally, register (& require) any dependencies you need.
	You should exclude the versions when using `dependencyManagement`.
	For example, to use `stellar-logging`:

	pom.xml ===================================================
	<dependency>
		<groupId>sirius.stellar</groupId>
		<artifactId>stellar-logging</artifactId>
	</dependency>
	===========================================================

	module-info.java ===============
	requires sirius.stellar.logging;
	================================

building
========

	The preferred environment includes Oracle GraalVM for Java 25 and the Apache
	Maven Daemon (mvnd), or any other suitable distribution of Maven.

	$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:siriushq/stellar.git
	$ cd stellar
	$ mvnd package

	An installation of GnuPG is required to run the `install` or `deploy` goals
	(alternatively, use `-Dgpg.skip` flag to skip, not recommended!)

============

	Currently, in general, contributions are not accepted.
	However, you can submit patches [1], or report issues/bugs to `stellar@mechite.com`.
	A response will always eventually be provided to anything delivered to this address.
