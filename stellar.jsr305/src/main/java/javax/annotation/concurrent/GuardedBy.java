/// - this : The string literal "this" means that this field is guarded by the class in which it is defined.
/// - class-name.this : For inner classes, it may be necessary to disambiguate 'this';
///   the class-name.this designation allows you to specify which 'this' reference is intended
/// - itself : For reference fields only; the object to which the field refers.
/// - field-name : The lock object is referenced by the (instance or static) field specified by field-name.
/// - class-name.field-name : The lock object is reference by the static field specified by class-name.field-name.
/// - method-name() : The lock object is returned by calling the named nil-ary method.
/// - class-name.class : The Class object for the specified class should be used as the lock object.
