siriushq/stellar.configuration.mutator
======================================

Shared testing utility for the development of configuration extensions for
`sirius.stellar.configuration.Configuration`, where reloading the state (which
is intentionally a protected action) is required.

Reflection is intentionally used to maintain the encapsulated contract.
In normal cases, the SPI (Service Provider Interface) system should be used
to provide sources of configuration at application startup only.
