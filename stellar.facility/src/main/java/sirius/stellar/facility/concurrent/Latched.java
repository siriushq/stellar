/// A wrapper around a given object of type `T`, with methods to wait until it is available.
///
/// This is thread-safe, and the [#set(Object)] method can be invoked from any thread; once
/// [#release()] has been invoked, [#get()] will return on every thread waiting for it, even
/// if the object is `null`; the control on when the object is available is separate from the
/// actual assignment of the object.
///
/// [#toString()] returns a message that contains the locked object, whether the latch has been
/// released or not â€” it can potentially display `"null"`, but is entirely null-safe and uses
/// [String#valueOf(Object)] in order to obtain this value. The message will appear as
/// `Latched[object=*]`, where `*` is `String.valueOf(latched.reference.get())`.
///
/// [#hashCode()] returns a hash code for the latched object if it has been set, or zero if it
/// has not (as [Objects#hashCode(Object)] is called).
///
/// [#equals(Object)] will return true if this latched object is equal to itself, false if the
/// object it is compared to is `null`, or true if the object it is compared to is another
/// latched object where the set object is deeply equal to this latched object's set object. The
/// deep equality is calculated with [Objects#deepEquals(Object, Object)]. If the latched object
/// is still locked, it will instead return false rather than trying to await the object's release,
/// as that qualifies as lack of equality.
///
/// This is checked with [#locked()], which in turn invokes [CountDownLatch#getCount()], which may
/// not be desirable behaviour.
