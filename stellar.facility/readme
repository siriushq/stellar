=========================

Provides utility classes that are considered to be so standard as to justify
existence in the Java standard library.

Compared to similar projects such as Apache Commons or Guava, this module is
designed for JDK >21, and therefore some essential portions of those libraries
which have been introduced into the standard library are missing here.

Some portions of this library have been adapted from Apache Commons, these
portions remain licensed under their original Apache-2.0 license and contain
clear license headers.

<!> This library is slowly being shrunk down and having parts extracted
    outside, until it can be completely deleted.
