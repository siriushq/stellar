siriushq/stellar.serialization.msgpack.jsonb
============================================

Adapter implementing support for the MessagePack binary format
to avaje-jsonb (under Apache-2.0).

This adapter is quite inefficient as it uses lazy-evaluation techniques to work
around the limited API of avaje-jsonb, essentially buffering the entire contents
that are to be written.
