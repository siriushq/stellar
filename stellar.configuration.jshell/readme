siriushq/stellar.configuration.jshell
=====================================

Provides configuration and hot-reload using JShell scripts.

Simply create a `.jsh` or `.jshell` script in the root directory, optionally
author a template file in your project resources folder (and declare in
your META-INF).

A dismissed expression evaluated in the script must be a `Map` of key-value
(`String, String`) entries, which is stored in the scratch variable `$1`.

You must be running under a JDK (Java Development Kit) to have access to
the JShell API that this provider uses.

These scripts are unsandboxed, and must be trusted; remote access to them
must be controlled or inaccessible, or they can be used as an attack vector
against your system (running under the privileges of your application).
