siriushq/stellar.logging.collect.csv
====================================

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) writer for making collectors of this format, for
the logging system. By default, this module does nothing, and should never be
depended on directly.

The following modules are available, which leverage (and transitively pull)
this module for writing this format to different destinations:

- [siriushq/stellar.logging.collect.csv.console]
- [siriushq/stellar.logging.collect.csv.file]
