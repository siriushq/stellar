siriushq/stellar.bom
====================

Bill of materials POM for managed dependency versioning.

Use this instead of `sirius.stellar:stellar` (which is also a BOM) to avoid
inheriting the other BOMs which that artifact includes (where it provides
centralized dependency management for external dependencies).

Alternatively, one can go the other direction, and use that one as a parent POM
to utilize both the centralized dependency management as well as the centralized
`pluginManagement` declarations.
