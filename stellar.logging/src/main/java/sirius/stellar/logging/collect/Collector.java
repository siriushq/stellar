/// Represents an operation that takes place when a logger message is emitted.

/// When implementing this interface, the [LoggerMessage] object emitted when

/// operations needed to, e.g., publish messages through a distributed log, can be
/// done safely, as it is expected that collectors are always invoked asynchronously.
///
/// This means that performance is predictable, log ordering is never affected, and
/// the impact logging has on your application is negligible. However, it is still
/// suggested that [Collector#task(Callable)] is used to schedule a task if it is
/// heavy enough that mixing the task with other virtual threads is desirable, i.e.,
/// if it does any heavy I/O operations that could affect the general performance
/// of your application.
