siriushq/stellar.logging.collect.json
=====================================

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) writer for making collectors of this format,
for the logging system. By default, this module does nothing, and should never
be depended on directly.

The following modules are available, which leverage (and transitively pull)
this module for writing this format to different destinations:

- [siriushq/stellar.logging.collect.json.console]
- [siriushq/stellar.logging.collect.json.file]
