siriushq/stellar.esthree.server
===============================

Wrapper of [siriushq/midio], providing a simple builder-pattern configuration
for establishing a testing server, and providing a standard Java entry-point for
running as a dedicated server, utilizing [siriushq/stellar.logging] for logging
and [siriushq/stellar.configuration] for configuration.

Use a Maven classifier to get the artifact required for your target system,
e.g. `windows-amd64`, and use Maven profiles to scope on the correct artifact,
to keep your build system portable (support for all platforms is desired).
